        "**THEORITICAL QUESTION**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Interpreted languages run code line by line (e.g., Python), while compiled languages convert the entire code into machine language before running (e.g., C, Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution. It uses `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks to catch and handle errors without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The `finally` block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen while a program runs. It helps in debugging and monitoring by recording messages, errors, and warnings. The `logging` module is used for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope to free resources. However, it is not commonly used because Python has automatic garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-- `import module` imports the whole module. You need to use `module.function()`.  \n",
        "- `from module import function` imports only a specific function. You can use it directly as `function()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-You can handle multiple exceptions in Python using a single `except` block with a tuple of exception types or multiple `except` blocks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 1: Using a tuple  \n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0\n",
        "except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:\n",
        "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 2: Using multiple `except` blocks  \n",

        "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid value!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The `with` statement is used to handle files in Python because it automatically closes the file after use, even if an error occurs. This prevents resource leaks and makes code cleaner. Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "    content = file.read()  # File is automatically closed after this block\n",
        "```\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",

        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Memory management in Python is the process of handling memory allocation and deallocation automatically. Python uses **reference counting** and **garbage collection** to free unused memory. The **Python Memory Manager** manages memory efficiently to optimize performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The basic steps in exception handling in Python are:  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Try** – Write the code that might cause an error inside a `try` block.  \n",
        "2. **Except** – Handle the error using an `except` block.  \n",
        "3. **Else** – (Optional) Run code if no error occurs.  \n",
        "4. **Finally** – (Optional) Execute code no matter what.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Example:  \n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0  # Error: Division by zero\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
        "finally:\n",
        "    print(\"This will always run.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Memory management is important in Python to optimize performance, prevent memory leaks, and ensure efficient use of resources. Python handles memory automatically using **garbage collection** to free unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-`try` and `except` are used for handling errors in Python.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- `try`: Runs the code that might cause an error.  \n",
        "- `except`: Handles the error if it occurs, preventing the program from crashing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Example:  \n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 10 / 0  # This will cause an error\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")  # This runs instead of crashing\n",
        "```\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Python's garbage collection automatically frees unused memory using **reference counting** and **cyclic garbage collection**. When an object's reference count drops to zero, Python deletes it. It also detects and removes circular references using the **gc module**.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.F What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In Python, the `else` block in exception handling runs if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The common logging levels in Python are:  \n",
        "\n",
